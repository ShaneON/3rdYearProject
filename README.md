#Soccer Coach Assistant

## My third year project

This app is for managers of sunday league football teams to record stats of each game. 
A graphical representation of a football pitch contains eleven players on it, and substitutes on the side.
When the manager sees an event occur during the game, he clicks the appropriate player, a pop up box then
shows a list of actions (tackle, shot, offside, etc..) of which he selects one and this is recorded into the phone.
The match stats are saved into a database on the phone using SQLite. When the manager wants to recall this data he can export
it as a csv file for use in Excel or another similar program.
